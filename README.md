# Musicl

[Play the game here](https://jduss4.github.io/musicl/)

Forked from [Byrdle](https://github.com/rbrignall/byrdle/), which was inspired by [Wordle](https://www.powerlanguage.co.uk/wordle/), written by Josh Wardle.

This version is for my music friends who really wanted Wordle, but with more Elgar and cello 5-letter magic.

I wouldn't copy this if I were you. I have stuck the dictionary and word targets into javascript files rather crudely, but you are welcome to [copy this copy of a copy](https://youtu.be/4frJxfrj_88) if you would like.
